####MAINT DESC####
AUS_DESC_MENU:0 "Following the great war the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed and Austria has found itself the sole remnant of the Habsburg crown. Despite devolution into chaos, the Austrian army held firm; securing the safety of the Germans under their occupation. Germany fell to a workers' state, their revolution spread to Hungary, and a mass delusion calls itself France, Austria is now isolated by antagonistic radicals. Kaiser Franz Ferdinand, despite his benevolence, is stubborn and inflexible - people crave change and radicals threaten the core of society. But whatsoever happens: Indivisible and Inseparable, Austria will endure."

austria.7.t:0 "The Red Massacare" 

austria.7.d:0 "After the war and the subsequent loss of much of the empire, the position of the crown has been the subject of great debate throughout many of the political circles. \n It was against this intense scrutiny that Kaiser Otto had called the members of his house, the elites of Austrian society, and the leading clique of the CSP to discuss where the monarchy's place within future of Austria. \n After two hours of dry conversation had passed, two guards assigned to the main entrance to the hall had stormed in, interrupting a talk being delivered by the statistician Breisky. What followed struck the very foundation of our society: \n one of the guards fired at the sitting Habsburgs whilst the other locked doors and gunned down any attempting to flee the massacre, \n the shooting alerted other guards of the palace the local police who responded within minutes. The two gun men had fortified their position and the hastily put together response quickly devolved into a siege - by the time the police were able to break into the hall and neutralise the gunmen several innocent civilians were caught in crossfire or mistakenly identified. \n Despite the attempt to physically end the Habsburg hold on Austria, three royals have avoided the wrath of the gunmen: \n Archdukes Otto, Robert, and Archduchess Adelheid. These three were quickly moved to their country home for their protection. Before the bodies of the royal family had even been taken out of the hall, many have started to point fingers at those they deem responsible and the royals are being declared martyrs by the resurgent monarchists.\n  Austrians of all banners lay blame to others for the deaths of the Habsburgs with the vast majority focussing on the alleged communist sympathies of the guardsmen whilst many leftists are suspicious of potential Heimwehr funding. \n Schuschnigg, justified by the national tragedy, has granted himself intense emergency powers much to the glee of the right and the ire of the left - as a response to the Ministerpräsident's tightening grip on politics socialists have left the Reichsrat and red brigades have taken to the streets to fight against the newly established Schuschnigg regime. \n If there's one thing all Austrians can agree on in these divided times it is that the peace died with the Kaiser."

austria.coup.d:0 "The success of the Fatherland Front in the elections has meant that Dolffuss has complete control over the entire Austrian government. The social democrats have been routed, the communists have fled to Germany, and the conservatives are either with us or to afraid to speak out. What this means is that Dollfuss finally has the chance to get what he always wanted; an ultranationalist Austria. \n This morning, an amendment was introduced called the “Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Empire”, which would radically reform the government. It was an amendment to the constitution that would give the Chancellor emergency powers for at least four years, until it would have to be voted on again by parliament. The vote was almost unanimously in favour of the act, and as his first act afterwards, Dolffuss replaced elections with a new corporatist system to be expanded on in the future. \n Now, democracy has died in Austria. The Fatherland Front reigns supreme, and a new age has begun. Whether it stands the test of time will have to be seen."

austria.17.d:0 "The Austrians have approached us with a proposal to aid in the defence against the reds who occupy the Fatherland: A bilateral military alliance. This proposed alliance would unite both our military commands together in order to share research, and organise training, exercises, and operations as well as a promise to defend one another against the red menace. Whilst there are many apparent benefits to this alliance, there is one part of the agreement that is less than desirable - Austria asserts that southern Germany should come under her occupation in the event we were to succeed in the liberation of the German Volk. Our government is divided whether we should accept the alliance to have a stronger chance to depose the oppressive communists or reject it in order to preserve our independence along with our claim as the rightful German government." 
austria.17.a:0 "Yes, We must work toogether."
austria.17.b:0 "We will liberate the fatherland without the help of the Austrians."

austria.18.t:0 "Enemies from the inside" 
austria.18.d:0 "The plot by the Ultranationalists has been foiled! The madman Dolfuss and that Sodomite Röhm have ruined themselves by attempted coup against the Austrian Republic. Now however, the Christlichsoziale Partei must deal with its many internal divisions. The figurehead of the ultraconservative wing of the CSP, Adolf Hitler, in secret plots the assassination of his party leader, Kurt Schuschnig. As he believes his tempered reforms will not be enough to save Austria from the storm soon approaching Europe. A lone gunman is sent to Schuschnig’s office in Vienna, and it is clear if apprehended, the action can simply be pinned on remnants of the Communist and Ultranationalist forces. Will this finally be the end of Austrian democracy?"
austria.18.a:0 "Ensure his entrance to the office."
austria.18.b:0 "Arrest him, and also arrest hitler at once!"
hitler_coup_tooltip:0 "Hitler and his supporters will secure a smooth takeover of the government"
austria.19.t:0 "The Prussains Accept!" 
austria.19.d:0 "The prussian athoritires have accepted the pact, We may now work toogether with our brothers to the north and liberate the fatherland."
austria.19.a:0 "Fantastic!"

austria.20.d:0 "The prussian athoritires have declined the pact, They cant be trusted to help with our righteous mission and choose to be secluded in their pathetic holding."
austria.20.a:0 "We are on our own."

austria.21.t:0 "Status of the Monarchy" 
austria.21.d:0 "Ever since our glorious leader, Engelbert Dollfuss has taken over the Austrian parliament the question of the monarchy has remained in somewhat of a limbo. While not officially abolished yet, Dollfuss had been convinced for quite some time that the Habsburg-Lothringen family is partially to blame for the situation Austria was in. He damned the multicultural empire for its incompetence and failures, and is steadily leading the nation to a better, brighter path. And yet, The question stands…\n should the old values and traditions of the Austrian monarchy shall be brought back under our new Regime, or remain to be forgotten as relics of the past? \n The Kaiser, back again to represent God and the country, would act as a symbolic figure, and a moral guide for the nation at large.  Still, having a head of state to challenge Engelbert Dollfuss’s ultimate power might be a dangerous power dynamic. \n A proposition was made: \n Dollfuss shall remain the Reichsprotektor as co-head of state and leader of the nation while the Habsburgs get to serve as a national symbol and monument."
austria.21.a:0 "Austria must move on, Dollfuss shall rule alone with an iron fist!"
austria.21.b:0 "The crown shall be reestablished."

austria.22.t:0 "The Kaiser’s Return" 
austria.22.d:0 "The proposition to restore the monarchy has been received quite fondly with the Austrian people. One problem stands: it is still unclear who shall be monarch. The three candidates consisted of Franz Ferdinand, Otto von Habsburg and Adelheid von Habsburg. \n Franz, as we already know, has done much to save Austria during the Great War, and has ruled us for many years. While being the obvious choice to many, his previous political affiliations might make it necessary to pass the crown to his nephew, Otto, which would probably be the safest pick.\n Finally, The more radical side of the party supports the coronation of Archduchess Adelheid, Otto’s Sister. She has been supportive of our movement, and has shown herself as a bright and powerful figure, fitting for Dollfuss’s  new regime, a clean slate to grow beyond the old bureaucratic and failed Habsburg estate. \n Now, Dollfuss must decide who must become the Reichsprotektor. The old regime, the reformist winds or the favorite of the fatherland?"
austria.22.a:0 "God Protect Kaiser Franz, the sign of stability and fairness in the empire!"
austria.22.b:0 "God Protect Kaiser Otto, the moral beacon of Austria!"
austria.22.c:0 "God Protect Kaiserin Adelheid, the beautiful sword of the fatherland!"

austria.23.t:0 "A Request From The Kaiserin" 
austria.23.d:0 "Despite the symbolic nature of the throne in the new Austrian Reich, that hasn’t stopped those who sit in it from trying to exercise and wield power. Adelheid first appeared to the members of the Fatherland Front as a non threatening and controllable monarch; she often looked embarrassed or scared during the first public gatherings. But more and more, the people in the party started to listen to her; behind closed doors, she met with individual officials and was able to sway them to whatever her cause was at that moment. Its clear to some that there is more than meets the eye here. \n Earlier today, Adelheid met with Reichsprotektor Dollfuss to discuss the issue of military reform. Adelheid said that while she had read much on army doctrine, she was still unsure about what was the best course of action. In order to come to a conclusion, therefore, she wanted to have a meeting with the officers of the army and discuss how to move forward on this. \n There is no doubt that she has a kind of influence and charisma that could challenge Dollfuss’s iron rule. He now has to decide on whether to let this by."
austria.23.a:0 "You have no place in military affairs. Keep your nose out!"
austria.23.b:0 "There is no reason to get hysterical. The Kaiserin may intervene when she feels the need to."

austria.24.t:0 "The Fall of the Dollfuss Regime" 
austria.24.d:0 "Everyone adored Dollfuss not that long ago. He was a confident speaker and reasonable to talk to in person. He once had an initiative and authority that meant he could grasp any situation and quickly act on it. Engelbert was a good person; but we need more! Austria was always first and foremost an Empire, and as such a strong Empress is needed. \n That night, officers of the Heimwehr stormed the parliament building and had numerous members of the Fatherland Front, including Dollfuss, and Rohm arrested and exiled. As he was guided out of the building by the soldiers, Adelheid felt a sense of regret as he looked upon her, dismayed and saddened. But again, she knew that Austria is safest in Habsburg hands. \n She will continue where Dollfuss left off, as far as the public is concerned, Dollfuss has resigned to the full authority of the Kaiserin. \n The new government declared that Adelheid was now Reichsprotektor und Kaiserin; the two positions had been merged into one, giving her full control over the entire government. Once again, Austria had entered a new age in her history, one led by a women with designs and ambitions of uniting the South Germans by any means necessary. If that meant pushing aside the moderates and even her own family, then so be it; the old and the weak are doomed."
austria.24.a:0 "Long Live Kaiserin Adelheid!"

austria.25.t:0 "Demands from Vienna" 
austria.25.d:0 "Much talk about the political future of our great nation has erupted since the presentation of certain demands from Austria and its far right government with Monarchist sympathies today from the Austrian embassy in Prague. The demands in question called for our increasingly unpopular King, Roman Petrovich of the house of Romanov, to abdicate and make way for a union with their nation and for a proper Habsburg to rule over us. Greater protection in this rapidly chaotic continent and increased economic prosperity and development are certainly benefits of a new Bohemia-Moravia, but many are convinced such a union would significantly reduce our autonomy. Many eagerly await a ultimate decision from our current King."
austria.25.a:0 "We Wanted to get rid of the Romanovs regardless..."
austria.25.b:0 "Austria will not force their puppet on our throne!"

austria.28.t:0 "Schuschnigg Calls For Elections" 
austria.28.d:0 "MWith the defeat of the rebellion and the scattering of any opposition, Schuschnigg is now faced with having to form a government. His opponents, be they Hayek’s liberals or Seitz’s social democrats, are organizing quickly, and Kurt’s legitimacy as the ruler is only really going to come from the people. So, as a result, he has called for elections. \n In a lot of ways, Schuschnigg is still a dictator. His powers have been extended in the face of civil war, and he used it to ruthlessly crush any and all opposition to his government. But Schuschnigg lacks the personality and will of one; he does not have Le Patron’s charisma, or Kolchak's iron will, or even d’Annunzio’s talented circle. He needs this election, for otherwise he lacks any serious legitimacy. And the opposition needs this election to steer Austria towards their goals and dreams, and him, into deeper corruption. \n Now, Schuschnigg, Hayek and Seitz begin to organize, for the moment of truth is just around the corner."
austria.28.a:0 "A new day for Austria.."

austria.29.t:0 " The Elections" 
austria.29.d:0 "A lot is on the line here.  /n If Schuschnigg wins, Austria shall return to a semi-constitutional monarchy, and will most likely go on the warpath in order to reclaim its empire and defeat the red Germans. Kurt has been adamant about his support for the royal family and their return, and has made no illusion to the fact that its empire should return. Seitz and the Social Democrats, The age old rival of the Conservatives have naturally contested this approach, wanting to create a proper republic instead. \n To the race also joined a more exotic candidate: The now infamous Economist Friedrich August von Hayek.Hayek Invisions a classical liberal economy built on renewed and improved principles to replace the old crumbling capitalist values. \n At last, the people have voted. The votes have been counted, everything is in their place, and it's time to announce the winner."
austria.29.a:0 "Schuschnigg preserves his powers, and the CSP have taken the reigns!"
austria.29.b:0 "Hayek and the WP win by the margin!"
austria.29.c:0 "Seitz and the SAPO crush the conservative block!"
