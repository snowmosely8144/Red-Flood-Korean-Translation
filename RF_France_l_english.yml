#BOOKMARKS#
FRANCE_FUTURIST_DESC:0 "After their failure in the Great War, France was thrown into chaos as its unstable Liberal Democracy collapsed onto itself. Street battles became commonplace and crushed any sense of peace. The masses demanded justice for the dead and the post war youth rejected reactionary traditions. While Reactionaries led by Action Française took power, it was too late as the economy collapsed following the shickwaves of the 1931 Crash. From this chaos Antonin Artaud, Le Patron of the National Surrealist movement rallied the masses and seized power. Now France is led by a radical new ideology, driven on by two needs, Speed and Revenge."

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_ANTONIN_ARTAUD_DESC:0 "Antonin Artaud, the Patron of France, has become the hero of the Artistic State, bravely leading the cliques of artists and disgruntled nationalists into a new nation. Antonin was born in 1896 in Marseille, and quickly became one of the most respected poets, writers, and dramatists in France, with a slow rise as his esoteric tastes in plays made him a favorite of many. With the collapse of the former French Republic, Artaud leads France steadily, with the reputation of a hero, liberator of the French nation against the Communist menace right at the doorstep."
POLITICS_GEORGES_BATAILLE_DESC:0 "Georges Albert Maurice Victor Bataille has been called a "perverted degenerate", the "renegade surrealist", and the "dark side of the Artistic State", and now he sits at the top of the pile, leading the Artistic State to most ardently follow his beliefs regarding economics, social policy, and everything else. A deeply devoted anarch, he wishes to create a France devoid of government, of law, and of internationalism, the drive of this new France being excess, sexuality, and individualist pleasure, along with mystical eroticism and aestheticism. Bataille's pious past in the Catholic Church made him deeply intertwined with spiritualism and mysticism, meaning an unique position regarding the future of France. The Renegade Surrealist has now risen from the backstreets of Le Soleil to the most respected aristocrat in the Artistic State."

france.5.d:0 "To celebrate the New Year of 1936, Artaud, the Patron of France, organized an immense public party in Marseille. beautifully ornate costumes and masks were encouraged, and lots of alcohol was available. The party lasted well into 7th of January, with fireworks fired out of artillery cannons flying into the ground, as many ancient Renaissance paintings were burned. In particular, Artaud picked out The Annunciation, by Rogier van der Weyden, a 1400s painting, and ejaculated on it, and simultaneously destroyed it with a powerful rifle with incendiary bullets. The painting was completely destroyed, and the crowds cheered. The party had minimal coverage from the outside world, except for three American journalists with positive views towards France.\nThe party has caused major damages to the city, but everyone had a great time, and now volunteers are cleaning up the mess and the city continues to be as fiery and as fast as usual."
france.5.a:0 "Le Patron seemed to have fun."
france.6.t:0 "A Relaxing Dinner"
france.6.d:0 "Today, Patron Artaud was having a meeting with the leader of the Acéphale, Georges Bataille, who strangely requested the Patron a few days back to talk about "friendship", despite the immense tensions between the newly estabilished cult around Artaud and the Acéphale secret society. Bataille offered Artaud some food and alcohol, and suddenly during the dinner, Artaud collapsed to the ground and became unconscious. Georges Bataille quickly told the news to Le Soleilians, and nominated himself the "Provisional Regent of France", in what some call a soft coup!"
france.6.a:0 "Seems like Artaud just couldn't handle the personality cult."
france.7.t:0 "France at War Again"
france.7.d:0 "The delicate and fragile balance in Europe has been finally brought to the ground as the Patron of France, Antonin Artaud, made a speech in Le Soleil declaring war on the United Kingdom. Artaud's speech starts with:\n"Comrades, warrior-poets, riders of steel horses, priests of war and lovers of art!"\nHe puts down his cane and adjusts his scarf.\n"This crucial moment is our chance, to paint a great image over Britain! To paint with our bombs , with our cars, using their blood as paint. The plutocratic-reactionary regime of Great Britain forced us to stand our ground and protect opressed masses of Asians, Africans and Europeans against the sterility of Anglo culture! The cancer of this world, center of uncreativity and bourgeois values is LONDON!"\nHe slams the cane against the ground, screaming energetically as he does dramatic, cathartic and visceral gestures.\n"Our troops are ready to fight, the Acéphale declared that the rituals and sacrifices are complete, and so we can expect that dark celtic gods will aid our invasion!"\nArtaud then left the podium and begun flying a plane with speakers on the sides, energetically screaming as the plane rose to the skyline.\n"The Anglo race failed to do most important historical task-they are not able to satisfy their women! We must help them out!" wise words of Le Patron echoed across our solar capital. "After this victorius war, we will put anglo race in their new historical place as a race of cuckolds!\nFirst raiding aircrafts are on their way to London to drop lewd pictures of our troops and love letters to future wives across The Channel."\nArtaud then flew away, throwing roses and fired a rifle in the air, to the clamor and praise of the residents in the city."

Most of their influence is in Brittany, but it’s slowly spreading as the younger generation of peasents is interested in sexual rituals. The Clique is heavily influenced by Yugoslav Zenitism and French Primitivism, declaring that Celtic tribes lived fast lives despite their technological backwardness, since true speed comes from mentality and not technology.\nMarc Augier, who is hailed as "Mestr", has already organised his followers into paramilitary group dressed in nothing, but fur of various wild animals. In the night, they claim they become true animals."

Among the rural countryside, peasants have been caught organizing prayer in secret, and our efforts in removing Christian imagery from historical buildings have been met by sabotage and internal resistance. Large masses of ignorant Papists have organized mass prayer demonstrations, demanding a return to tolerance of their vile superstition. These protesters have already attacked police merely for doing their jobs of containing the protests. With the protests only growing in size, we must quickly respond."

Based on our extensive research from our party’s greatest scientists, we have concluded that all of human thought has originated from a common futurist singularity, which is embodied by our one great Patron. Therefore, we are reforming our entire education system to reflect this eternal truth: our history books start with the ascension of Le Patron, our literature consists of Le Patron’s writings, and our mathematics are geared towards preparing a generation of engineers, architects, and mechanics. Of course, some educators worry that these reforms will harm children’s education, but upon further analysis, these teachers were found to be uneducated and therefore charged with wrongful employment. Additionally, to ensure a consistent and efficient economy, our industrial production is now being adjusted and regulated according to these enlightened standards."

france.12.desc:0 "\"Who are you?\" Le Patron said to the void around him. \"We are all, we are within you.\" the voices responded. \"We are everything, and we are your dominion.\" Le Patron has emerged, against the deceitful lies about his mental state, as a godly pantheon bound by one body! All of existence has gazed in amazement at his incredible intellect, his might which evaporates all in his way! Now, however, he has told us amazing news; we are merely an extension of his own soul! Such great news brought awed and overjoyed shock throughout the nation; people lined up in the streets in euphoric silence, many crying out of pure joy. Some found themselves driven to hysterics by this wonderful news, and were humanely dispatched. Of course, there were a few traitors exposed in these proceedings, as some in academia, and even our own ranks, found themselves relying on \"facts\" and \"logic\" to dismiss our absolutely true claims. Such treason could not be tolerated, and has been dismissed in the name of us; \"Le Patron!\"."

From algebra to kerosene to even cryptanalysis; my brethren, without Islam’s cotributions, futurism would not even exist today!\" The sheer force of this powerful speech drove out any withheld doubts towards futurism, as the entire Islamic world found itself moved to follow the way of our great Patron. Even the most hardline of critics found themselves silenced out of awe, and the atmosphere of the Congress was a bonafide accelerationist frenzy. Truly, a kinships has been found in our two peoples."

However, upon the great Patron’s recent Islamic Reformation Initiative, these impoverished children will now have the opportunity to learn valuable skills such as literacy and arithmetic. As Le Patron announced to an audience of overjoyed children: \"With skill, practice, and sheer willpower, you all can become like the great Patron!\""

Therefore, we must revise the lasting decadence from our late imperial carcass. We shall destroy the central demagogues; the Papal fools; the accursed plow which has enslaved us so!\" Throughout the streets, Druidist legionaries burned effigies of Caesar, Einstein, Ford, and other despots of machinery. Children lined up gleefully to receive face paintings of Celtic runes upon their face, as these same runes are carved across every building in Le Soleil. Despite massive support amongst our rural population, some traitors within our industry cannot accept their rightful expulsion from our society. Therefore, we have no mercy for such treason; they shall feel justice by our wolves . . ."

There he stood, a glorious son of futurism, hair gleaming, smile shining, eyes glowing. Le Patron stood even more beautiful and proud than his deputy, his spirit radiating across all of France. However, as the crowd roared for these new declarations of the Futurist birthright, a treacherous and despicable shadow loomed within the passionate patriots. This shadow, later revealed to be a deranged Escadron fanatic unable to accept France’s true destiny, approached the great Augier as he spread his joy to the crowd. Upon being within three meters of our beloved Druid, the assassin pulled out a handgun and fired at Augier. The crowd recoiled in horror, and several brave and glorious patriots tackled the gunman, beating him to death in a wave of heroic rage. However, a shot still left the gun, and . . ."

Join your brethren in the ashbin of history.\" As the crowd roared and jeered at the body being hauled away.

This body is just flesh, a mere mass of atoms hurtling towards the future. It’s my soul which aches; I close my eyes, and I just see the flash, feel the sting, hear the screams. God, those screams. Every moment, those screams ring just out of consciousness, screaming, yelling, serenading, for my demise. I wish they’d leave my head\"\nArtaud leaned over to Augier, and whispered gently in his ear, \"Don’t worry, I hear them too.\"\nAugier’s eyes widened, and utters, \"So, why are they here? What do they want?\"\n\"They want what’s best. Listen to them. They know more than you. Here what they have to say.\"\nAugier contemplated, then gave an uneasy smile. \"I need to face this blinding light head on: the light of science, of reason, of the damned plow itself.

france.20.desc:0 "Big news in France today as most of the industrial centers of the nation have been destroyed for forest reclamation programs. Le Soleil and other large cities have already been plowed of all but its most essential buildings, and several towns have been evacuated to allow vegetation to grow back into the former infrastructure. The residents have been relocated to small and simple (luxuriously austere) houses in the South. While they will learn to love these new forests and new homes in time, at the moment, they prove to be rather angry, with protests emerging throughout the nation. Of course, these poor urbanites were found to be deceived by traitors, and luckily our brave militia eliminated these foreign troublemakers. Although a few say our ideas are too radical, the sight of a child finally being able to play in the woods disproves all detractors of the Druid cause."

The scene produced a haunting show of the horrors of urban existence, as the crowd mourned from being removed from their addictive suburbia. Poor children, entranced by the industrial opium, burst into tears upon being escorted from their homes. Even some pathetic adults broke down from their withdrawal. Luckily, our militiamen were there to knock this disgusting display from the crowd, lest others feel comforted in their addiction. Upon marching a mile from the city, the crowd’s tears were illuminated by a sudden blaze from their former home. The patchwork homes in the former impoverished sector provided kindling for the blaze, as armed explosives destroyed the major landmarks. The crowd began to cry out in anguish as the Eiffel tower was rattled by explosives under its base. Some even began to attack the militia, and were adequately repelled with necessary force for such a serious evil. As the caravan began to move to their wonderful new luddite shelters, a woman began to cry uncontrollably. As a militiaman addressed her calmly, the following conversation was recorded:\n\nWoman: \"I can’t go on . . . I lost everything . . . (sobs)\"\nMilitia: \"What do you mean? You now have freedom, austerity, autonomy, and liberation from the monotony of industrial hell.

So far, our birthrates have quadrupled, and, with nature taking its natural course on the more unfit, a new generation of warriors is on the horizon. However, when we allowed open love-making, we never imagined that a certain . . . \"flamboyant\" trend would emerge. This morning, as one of our militia investigated odd noises coming from a local settlement, a grizzly sight emerged: eighteen men were found engaging in . . . pleasures of their own. Even some prominent local leaders were found in the orgy, shocking the foundation of our support. With this knowledge, 69 other gay relationships were exposed within our borders! Unfortunately, our lack of government prevents us from doing anything about it."

A massive horde of Druid loyalists marched upon a bunker in the Ardennes, containing a cartel of Nungesser loyalists. Unfortunately, as our brave men approached the bunker, the damned industrial weapons quickly gained the upper hand, shredding many of our soldiers to shreds. However, as the bloody battle continued and our men refused to stop advancing, some of our valiant heroes used suicidal demolition attacks to destroy many of the artillery pieces. Eventually, the weary cowards surrendered to a plea deal for their lives. Of course, we refused to fulfill this deal with such terrorists, and promptly slaughtered them on the spot. One of these savages was Nungesser himself, whose corpse could not be recovered due to understandably high torture and degradation from our valorous heroes. Still, this battle of heavy casualties has exposed many humiliating flaws in our system . . ."

Many, if they could not relinquish their property, were instead volunteered by our men to become noble heroes for the primitive cause. However, despite taking great pains to help them in such dire need, some are still ungrateful. In Brittany, a province once so supportive of us and instrumental in our rise, has betrayed our just cause. As we came to relieve them of their burden, these ungrateful Bretons have instead raised their hideous black-and-white rags in defiance of our liberty. Despite being outnumbered and occupied, these imperialist oppressors still refused our will, and brawled with our forces.

Today was not a normal training flight, instead of their usual instructor the squadron was led by a warrior-priest. He was dressed in a rough ox-skin jacket, which along with his helmet was painted in ornate and colourful patterns.\n\nAs they got into their planes and left the airfield, Anton's adrenaline was already rushing through his veins. They flew lower than normal for a good while until suddenly he could hear the warrior priest's voice through the radio, distorted by noise. \"Ok men, after me!\" the Priest said as Antonie could see his plane fly straight up into the sky, with the rest of the squadron following suit. It was then Antonie could feel it. As the G-forces was pushing on his body he could feel his Soul escaping his body, behind him the curtains of reality were unveiling, revealing the superworld. As his Soul was ascending he could feel the marrow in his bones being pushed down towards the ground. Whilst the Priest was chanting nonsensically through the radio Antonie felt his soul leaving him completely, the sensation knocking him unconscious. When he regained his senses he was in a black tunnel, at the end of it he saw the ground accelerating towards him, as he travelled through the tunnel closer to its opening he could feel himself regain power over his body.\n\nHe was shot out of the tunnel and back into reality, his plane speeding down towards the Earth. Antonie quickly, almost instinctively, pulled up his plane, again experiencing the orgasmic feeling of his soul leaving its mortal prison, almost losing consciousness again. It was only once Antonie re-joined the formation of planes that he truly regained his sense of reality, the low rumble that had covered his ears quickly turned to his friends' voices coming from the radio. \"Antonie!? Antonie are you alright!?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm doing great.\""

Suddenly he heard his comrade’s voice in the radio, \"Enemies coming in 12 O'clock.\". He looked up and saw in the distance, slightly below them many formations of planes heading straight in their direction. Finally, what he signed up for. Already the Brits had started firing against them, their bullets whizzed past the formations below him, already speeding up, like rows of Napoleonic soldiers advancing on the British lines at waterloo. But he was above them. The planes below him were foot soldiers, he and his squadron were the Cavalry, the Escadron.\n\"Very well men, at my signal.\" Antonie said, carefully awaiting the moment, \"Now!\" he shouted, shooting his plane straight towards the British planes. As his plane and comrades accelerated towards the enemy, Antonie was no longer in his plane, in fact he was no longer on earth. He had been transported to space, like he had many times before, around him were stars and planets, at his side armies of angles were flying past him, on their way to annihilate anything in their path. But Antonie did not care for them, he was focused on controlling his empty body in his plane, like a remote-controlled robot. Antonie’s squadron was charging the enemy from above, their heads filled with blood, their eyes were bloodshot and Antonie saw reality in a red hue. He pressed down on his triggers, his face was bright red and grimaced by the g-force.

"For too long, we have found our spirits bound by petty things like morality and austerity. If we wish to reach a further plane of reality, we must delve into the great reaches of the mystically orgasmic beyond!" Le Patron declared to a crowd of enthralled supporters. Immediately after delivering a powerful ode to immorality, he passed the spotlight to Bataille. Bataille immediately began a tirade on the esoteric potential of hedonism, in which he recounted an extraordinarily enlightening experience he had with several of Paris’s finest prostitutes. Then he began relaying his promises: to the children he promised the finest sweets and candies; to the adults he promised sex and hallucinogens. As he made this decree, a unit of Acephale partisans walked throughout the crowd, handing out gifts of chocolate and opium respectively. Despite massive euphoria amongst the crowds, a few hard-line Escadronists and Druidists protested at the event; even Augier and Nungesser themselves somehow managed to cooperate in jointly leading the protests. However, upon being escorted into the Palais Bourbon, the protesters were greeted by a crowd of our nation’s finest women adorned in very little. Needless to say, after hours of pleasure on the very capital floors, the men finally understood our grand vision for spiritual liberation.

The Acts of Confederation, while a stroke of liberating and experimental genius from the pen of Le Patron himself does not exist without temporary setback.\nThis newfound autonomy has infected the french countryside with the attitude of a dog on a new leash, testing its boundaries, how far it can push its master’s patience. Such exercises in defiance at this point in time are minor. Nothing more than acts of cultural insolence. A flag of the old republic here, the spouting of old adages of a past revolution there, and the worship of some irreverent ‘Savior’ (certainly not our Artaud!).

Eventually, a few of our police approached and apprehended the woman, as she screamed \"AM I BEING DETAINED?!\" and other arguments that our actions were tyrannical.

However, despite these grand dreams, Nungesser had one major oversight; he knows absolutely nothing about law. As he made his opening remarks, he clearly put very little thought into creating an argument; he quickly lost his professionalism and began rambling about how decadence is anti-Futurist for vague and illogical reasons. As eventually, as he found himself losing the previously-sympathetic courtroom, he began screaming at the defendant, calling her a disgusting reactionary and traitor to the futurist cause. While Ms. Clemence certainly wasn’t popular, very few people could justify Nungesser’s mad ravings. Eventually, he ran out of steam, and began timidly questioning the bewildered woman; even still, he struggled to attribute any particular crime to her. After this haphazard effort, he gave up."

Despite Abram’s reluctance, he still managed to assemble an excellent defense in favor of the woman. He clearly explained that her actions, while disgusting to us on a moral level, were indisputably ethical. After all, she did not harm any living creature, her sale of her fetus was based on voluntary exchange, and after the latest Decadence Decree, she couldn’t have violated any obscenity laws for they no longer existed!

On this afternoon, Ms. Clemence was dragged past a throng of furious citizens, who understandably screamed extreme obscenities at her. One even managed to throw a bottle at Clemence’s head, shattering and cutting her face before the man could be detained. The woman gave one last plea for mercy before she was forcibly slammed into the bull. As the bull gave its infamous steam whine, her screams of pain could barely be heard. Eventually, after the bull finished its infernal execution, Clemence’s body was removed, to be mocked and desecrated by the mob, which they were happy to do.

As the convoy reached their armored car, Ms. Clemence gave one last \"Screw you all!\" to the world before disappearing to her relocated home. Having forever lost their chance at justice, the mob instead turned their anger upon Paris itself.

All pride was wrung out of the country and its people, its dignity bled out in the fields of Verdun and Champagne. It was a sorry state, and Maurice could not blame those who let it degenerate further.

He didn't really care what some raving lunatic was saying, screaming about freedom, restoration of France, some vague and ill-defined dream of deposing Artaud and recreating a France that would inevitably fail just as the old one they loved . It didn't matter. He sat, and watched the madman rave.\n\nThree militia-men were laughing with each other, talking about the man they were charged with executing. It was a mercy, really. Sometimes, people were just so far-gone that to call them people anymore was a form of torture. There were many madmen in France, people so blinded by some love of the past, some desire to preserve what never worked, and Artaud just...did not understand it. It was understandable, of course, that one would want to keep things the same. Status quos are comfortable. But they are also the bane of progress, something to be disregarded despite the discomfort. The unknown, the fear that you felt with something new, was no different than the pain in muscles one had after a good run. It was a sign of improvement. Those who denied that would rather watch their own collapse than embrace their future.\n\nAnd now, Artaud watched the militia raise their rifles. Maurice stared at him, trying...trying to find some of remanent of mercy, some humanity, something other than pure calculation, in his eyes.\n\nHe found none, and died sobbing."

france.54.desc:0 "The recent escalation of conflict between the differing personalities of the Escadron movement has intensified to an unprecedented degree. The economic question has evidently lit a spark between the egos of our tendencies luminaries. What was once typical squabbles in the various Parsian clubs has turned into fistfights with some cases even involving weapons. One such incident occurred between supporters of Pierre Clementi and adherents of Marcel Bucard’s economic policy. In a Parisian bar a heated discussion between the two groups turned first to name calling, the Clementi faction calling Bucard’s supporters \"bourgois dogs\" and the \"vestiges of the old corrupt regime who should of been burned alongside it\" whilst the advocates for Bucccard named the Clementists as \"degenerate communists who should fuck off to Germany\", which then turned into a frightful scuffle. As the fight spilled out onto the streets, blood threatened to swarm the district as the combattants brandished knives, brass knuckles, clubs and razors. As heads were beaten, eyes were slashed and bodies mutilated it soon became apparent to all those who had heard the news of the clash that the Escadron was not as united as it appeared. The display of ruthless unabashed violence by apparent members of the same organisation meant this issue had to be put to bed and soon. Any prolonging threatened to shatter the alliance that sought to achieve a French Utopia."

In order to ensure that, we’ve begun meetings and discussions with Henry Dorgères, the leader of the Green Shirts and the founder of numerous Peasants’ Defense Committees. Dorgères had been an important figure during the overthrow of the republicans, as his Green Shirts were often the shock troops against republican revival in the countryside, most infamously during the suppression of a republican revolt in the Vendée region. However, he was dismayed by the popularity of the Escadron and Acephale factions, and started to help organize support for the Druidists out of spite.\nHenry Dorgères has put forward two demands; one, that the Green Shirts are recognized by the government as a legitimate organization, and that the Peasants’ Defense Committees are merged with the government to ensure that the countryside is safe from any danger. This is a lot to ask, but Dorgères has been a helpful figure, and it may do us well to work with him."
