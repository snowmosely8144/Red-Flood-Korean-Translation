#Leader(s)#
POLITICS_Roman_von_Ungern-Sternberg_DESC:0 "Born in Austria to Baltic-German nobles of the Russian Empire, Nikolai Robert Maximilian von Ungern-Sternberg was a decorated cavalry officer of the Russian Empire, serving his Tsar in the Caucasus during the Great War. When Russia collapsed he joined the White Army in Siberia and quickly made a name for himself, defeating revolutionary forces with his band of brutal, multi-national cavarlymen. The chaos in Russia and deteriorating position of the Republicans in China allowed 'The Mad Baron' to carve out a small kingdom for himself on the Russian-Mongol border region of Tuva, near Lake Baijkal. The Baron may have been raised in the Russian Orthodox Church, but his fascination with Chinese-Mongol esoteric Buddhism has lead him to some strange religious beliefs. Combined with his loyalty to a Tsar who does not rule and an Empire that no longer exists, Sternberg now works to complete his dream of a religiously syncretic Eurasian Empire."
