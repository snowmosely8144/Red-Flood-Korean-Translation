#EVENTS
spr.1.t:0 "The Popular Front Wins the Election"
spr.1.d:0 "The Popular Front has come out on top! The coalition of liberal republican and left-wing parties has defeated the broad right-wing parties attempting to hold on to power. The coalition has drawn ire from critics due to its inclusion of anarchist, councilist and even vanguardists into its broad force, and although they won the popular vote, they still aren’t really popular. Regardless, they have triumphed in the ballot boxes, and now they will be deciding government policy in the years to come."
spr.1.a:0 "Long Live The Republic"
spr.2.t:0 "The Firing of President Alcala-Zamora"
spr.2.d:0 "Today, after much debate and discussion, the Popular Front replaced President Niceto Alcala-Zamora and will soon convene to find a new candidate. Zamora was a traditionally liberal president, and continuously frustrated his coalition with his attempts to dissociate himself with the leftist wings of the party, while trying to compromise and work with conservative republicans. His laissez faire approach to economics made even the most moderate of social democrats confused and dismayed, and it was only a matter of time before he was thrown out. The problem for the Front, however, doesn’t stop there. The news that a socialist president will be in charge has caused unrest within the army officer corps, as many of them are either conservative republicans, monarchists or even national-rejuvinationists. While the army is supposed to be apolitical, as we don’t want armed strongmen taking the reigns of power just because their guy didn’t get elected, that sadly isn’t the case. And now, we are left with a mess."
spr.2.a:0 "So Long, Zamora"
spr.3.t:0 "General Franco’s Letter"
spr.3.d:0 "Today, a letter has come in from army officer Fransisco Franco detailing what he claims to be a plot by army officers to overthrow the republic. According to him, a coalition of conservatives, Alfonso loyalists and even accelerationist officers have deemed the left-leaning Popular Front a threat to Spain, and are planning on overthrowing the republic and establishing a dictatorship of some kind. This letter is surprising; Franco has made his contempt for the Popular Front known, and has made no illusion to his monarchist sympathies. So to see him now inform us of a coup, and advice as to how to crush it, is quite shocking."
spr.3.a:0 "A Surprise to be Sure, But a Welcome One"
spr.4.t:0 "The Fate of Franco"
spr.4.d:0 " Franco’s letter has given our government a remarkable degree of information, and has helped us prepare quite a bit for the attempts to take down our government by the politicized officer corps. Franco, however, is insistent that he knows how to defeat this movement; he has said that in order to win, the leftists within the government will need to be kicked out of the coalition, and to make a general loyal to the republic like him Supreme Commander of Spanish Armed Forces. This proposition it pretty far out there; it's obvious that he wants to be the commander, and a few in the party haven’t bought the “kick out the left wingers” argument; they’ve even suggested having him stationed in the Canary Islands as exile in response. But he does have talents as a leader and general that could be useful, and considering the monopoly the right has on the officer corps, we need all the help we can get. So, what do we do?"
spr.4.a:0 "Oh, how convenient, Franco! You have a new posting in the Canary Islands!"
spr.4.b:0 "His advice is solid. Bring him into the movement."
spr.5.t:0 "A Letter From Sanjuro"
spr.5.d:0 "Franco was sitting at his desk in the Canary Islands when the letter came his way. He had spent most of his time there watching the clock go by; it was hardly an eventful job. This letter, from Jose Sanjurjo, was not merely a nice break from the norm, but very important. Sanjurjo had been one of the leading figures in the anti-republican officer corps, and was now a major general in the Nationalist side. Sanjurjo was still quite bitter about Franco exposing their plot to the government, but he said that it was necessary in times like these to forgive and forget. After all, Spain needed them, to fight off the godless socialists and republicans.Franco knew what to do. He had done much to help the republic, and all they did was exile him to some island in the middle of nowhere. Now, it wasn’t just politics; it was personal. Franco and his army would leave the islands and join the nationalists on the homeland. Change was in the air."
spr.5.a:0 "Glory to Spain! Down with the Traitors!"
spr.6.t:0 "Emilio Mola’s Demotion"
spr.6.d:0 "The increased political involvement of the officer corps has boiled over even more with the demotion of Emilio Mola. Mola, a major general in the army, was demoted for back-talking a higher up for what he claimed was “subservience to the socialists”, and had been sent to lead the army in Morocco as punishment. For a while, it was thought that it was an excellent solution to the problem; isolating the generals who oppose the government could mean that the republic is preserved and kept safe from violent elements. But talk spreads fast. The men in the Moroccan army found his arguments interesting and provocative, and Emilio has been able to slowly build up support from there. Now, this post is a ticking time bomb; Emilio could have control over the entire Moroccan army, made up of veterans of colonial wars and foreign expeditions. What once seemed brilliant is now unbelievably stupid."
spr.6.a:0 "It can’t be that bad, right? Right?!"
spr.7.t:0 "Cracking down on the Falange"
spr.7.d:0 "The increased violent activities has finally given the government a chance to seriously crack down on their activities. Police all around the country have been shutting down meetings and forcibly disbanding parties and organizations in any way sympathetic to the Falangist cause and ideology. Protests by these groups are also being met with disruption and arrest, which have usually been met with violence as well. One problem, however; this isn’t really working. The Falange now seem like a rebellious group to many of the youth, and more and more young people are joining far-right political clubs and organizations. If Falangism is a fire, then we just poured gasoline on it."
spr.7.a:0 "This Isnt Good"
spr.8.t:0 "Cooperation with the Church"
spr.8.d:0 "The church is so vital and important to the Spanish nation that to ignore them would be suicide. So many Spaniards, be they left or right wing, still get their morals and sense of self from the Catholic Church. While many on the far-left have said that we need to either ignore the church or be harsher on segregation, we know how it would end. Either we cooperate or we die. Our government has promised to respect the autonomy of the church and to lighten up on secular teachings in public schools, and in exchange, the church has promised to stay out of politics and to respect the authority of the republic. It's not an ideal compromise, but it does mean we can further isolate the Falangists and increase our hold on the country."
spr.8.a:0 ""
spr.9.t:0 "Anger from the Radicals"
spr.9.d:0 "While our compromise and negotiations with the church have gone well with most of Spain, some are quite openly angry. Both the far-left and far-right have criticized our government for this, albeit for different reasons. The left has said that our dealings have violated the principles of secular republicanism, and that working with the church is a waste of time. The right, on the other hand, have called the church traitors to the nation, and Jose Sanjurjo even openly declared that “every priest who works with the communists is a traitor and Judas incarnate. Let me ask you, citizens, should the church be loyal to Madrid or Berlin? Because I know what I want it to be loyal to!” Mola’s ramblings may only represent a radical few, but this discontent could hurt us in the future if we don’t play our cards carefully."
spr.9.a:0 "Why are you booing me? I’m right!"
spr.10.t:0 "Strengthening the Popular Front"
spr.10.d:0 "The increased activity of the Falangist groups within our country has meant that the Popular Front will need to unify more than ever in order to win. The liberal parts of the coalition have sat down with numerous leaders from the anarchist CNT-FAI and the Communist Party in order to ensure further cooperation. In exchange for a continued partnership, the liberals have agreed to support legislation in favour of higher wages, increased unionization, more cultural autonomy for Catalonia and the Basque region and support for left-wing militia groups. This has been met with fury by both conservative republicans and the far-right arguing that this proves that liberalism and communism are working hand in hand in order to destroy Spain. Most far-left groups, on the other hand, are quite enthusiastic, and are singing the praises of the republican government. How much longer this coalition will last is unknown, but it has bought itself far more time."
spr.10.a:0 "For the Republic1"
