SWEDEN_NORWAY_DESC:0 "During the Velikaya Voyna, Sweden has become a strong neutral country by refusing to participate in the war. Sweden refused to help Germany take over Finland, and signed the neutrality pact instead alongside with Norway and Denmark. Germany did not take to this kindly, and in a last ditch effort attacked Denmark. Sweden quickly responded by sending troops to Copenhagen and helping them fight against the Germans. However, the Danish government fell quickly, forcing Sweden to install a Swedish government in Denmark to ensure stablity and to repel the socialists. After Denmark managed to form a stable government, Sweden guaranteed their indepedence. Sweden helped Norway fight off the socialist uprising, and in the end got into a union with Norway."
