POLITICS_Roman_von_Ungern-Sternberg_DESC:0 "러시아 제국의 발트 독일계 귀족으로 오스트리아에서 태어난 니콜라이 로베르트 막시밀리안 폰 웅게른-슈테른베르크는 훈장까지 받은 러시아 제국의 기병장교로 대전쟁 동안에는 카프카스에서 차르를 위해 복무했습니다. 러시아가 멸망하자 그는 시베리아의 백군에 가담해 그의 잔인한 다국적의 기병들로 혁명세력들을 패퇴시키며 이름을 날렸습니다. 러시아가 혼란해지고 중국의 공화주의자들의 상황이 악화되자 '미친 남작'은 러시아와 몽골의 경계에 있는 바이칼 호 근처의 투바 지방에 스스로 작은 왕국을 세웠습니다. 남작은 러시아 정교회에서 길러졌지만 중국과 몽골의 심원의 불교에 매혹되어 뭔가 이상한 종교적 믿음을 가지게 되었습니다. 이것이 통치하지 않는 차르와 더이상 존재하지 않는 제국에 대한 충성과 결부되며 슈테른베르크는 이제 종교적으로 혼합된 유라시아 제국이라는 그의 꿈을 완수하는 데 매진하고 있습니다."
