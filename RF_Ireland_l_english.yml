#LEADER DESCRITIONS#

#IDEAS#
IRE_cold_civil_war:0 "Cold Civil War"
IRE_cold_civil_war_desc:0 "Officially the Irish civil war ended in 1923, but truly the Irish civil war has never ended. The Irish republican army has gone underground continuing its terror attacks to free Ireland from all British rule, while Pro Treaty groups led by Richard Mulcahy lead the government working for the British government. Both sides fight with their paramilitary groups but overall it has been peaceful compared to the previous Irish civil war, but tension is rising slowly and could easily explode."
IRE_economic_catastrophe:0 "Economic Catastrophe"
IRE_economic_catastrophe_desc:0 "When the British stock market crashed the Irish economy was harmed but spared from the worst of it, but now with the New York stock exchange crash of 1934 and the “Great Slump” the Irish economy has completely collapsed. With unemployment higher than ever before, people are doing whatever to get by whether this is leaving to the UK or the USA, or turning to a life of crime. While the economy has already started to slowly improve further change is rapidly needed."
IRE_black_and_tans:0 "Black and Tans"
IRE_black_and_tans_desc:0 "The Black and Tans still exist and operate in Ireland even with the civil war over as a force to help fight the IRA. While weakened due to Britain focusing on other areas of the empire they are still a major power player in Ireland. However they are widely disliked by the Irish population due to their brutality and often interfere with the Irish government. While the British government have restrained them, a careful balancing act must continue to restrain the Black and Tans while using them as a effective force. If they are too weak the IRA benefit, if they are to strong then only bad events could occur."
