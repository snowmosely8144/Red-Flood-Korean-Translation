KOLCHAK_RUSSIAN_DESC:0 "키예프에서의 니콜라이 2세 살해가 러시아를 뒤흔들었습니다. The government of confidence led by Prime Minister Stolypin stabilized the country and 2차 조국전쟁 또한 이겨냈습니다. But the war broke the spirit of the Russian people. The socialists along with the traitorous liberals plunged the country into turmoil. The collapse of the country was stopped through the efforts of the officers and people who remained faithful to the oath. A decade has now passed and Russia has recovered. Alexander Kolchak holds the steering wheel firmly but the clouds thickened over Russia. Will the admiral withstand the coming flood or will the stream blow Russia to the rocks?"

#EVENT
russia.1.t:0 "휴가계획"
russia.1.d:0 "Finally I have finished most of my businesses at hand and have plenty of time to enjoy a vacation! I shall go to one of my properties away from Petrograd to relax myself from the cutthroat politics and gloomy weather here.There are several relaxing places I can visit on my vacation. All of them are different compared to Petrograd, but a somewhat closer destination might mean a safer journey...perhaps? "
russia.1.a:0 "얄타로 가서 햇빛이나 쬐야겠네!"
russia.1.b:0 "얄타는 작년에 갔잖나. 대신 노보시스크로 가지."
russia.1.c:0 "일을 끝내기 전엔 멀리 가지 않을 걸세. 리파바가 괜찮겠군."
russia.2.t:0 "The Prince of Darkness"
russia.2.d:0 "Today, the famous writer Mikhail Bulgakov published a novel titled "The Prince of Darkness", work that he considers to be his greatest achievement.\nThe book, while having several subplots such as Jesus Christ being rejected by Jews and the struggle of a talented avantguarde poet against a conservative artist elite, is mostly known for strange element of the Devil-Woland showing up in Moscow. At first shown as all powerful evil entity, Woland is quicky locked up by corrupt police officers and later tortured by Okhrana. Once relased on the streets of Moscow, Woland is facing series of misfortunes caused mainly by the old tsarist administration. After several days in Moscow, Woland declares that even Hell is better and returns, saying Moscow doesn't need the devil so long as Kolchak is there."
russia.2.a:0 "Horrible slander, ban the book right away."
russia.2.b:0 "It's rather funny, let it be."
russia.3.t:0 "얄타에서의 운명의 날"
russia.3.desc:0 "This vacation was everything Kolchak needed, and its end aggravated him. He was fishing along the Black Sea, relaxing and nearly falling asleep to the sound of waves crashing on the rocks. Then, in a flash, a squad of loyal army officers grabbed him and rushed him to their car. They had explained that they believed that Drozdovsky was attempting to assassinate him, and they had proof that anti-Kolchak agents disguised as anarchists had already raided his vacation home in an attempt to find him. Kolchak sighed, realizing that his short-lived vacation was now over.\n\nAs they drove through the streets of Yalta, desperately trying to reach the evacuation point at the airport, the driver realized they were being followed. As if on cue, shots rang from the following car, and the driver put the pedal to the floor and began to swerve. Loyalist officers in the back ordered Kolchak to get down, as they swung out pistols of their own and fired back, and friendly police cars started to attempt to intercept the assaulters vehicle. Drozdovsky’s assassins swerved off, and for a moment, it looked like they were gone.\n\nThey arrived at the airport, and Kolchak and his men ran to the airplane parked on the tarmac. Out of nowhere, the car from before burst through the gates, and the driver quickly pulled out his gun and opened fire on Kolchak. As the bullet sailed towards him, one thought crossed Kolchak’s mind:"
russia.3.a:0 "\"Goodnight, Rodina. The heavens have called me to sleep.\""
russia.3.b:0 "\"I shall not die yet. Russia still needs me!\""
russia.4.t:0 "알렉산드르 콜차크의 죽음"
russia.4.desc:0 "\"It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that Alexander Kolchak, the Supreme Leader of all of Russia, is dead.\" Mikhail Drozdovsky declared over radio. The news was shocking; wasn’t he just on vacation? \"Yesterday at 2:00 in the afternoon, Kolchak and his men were attacked at an airport in Yalta by anarchists loyal to those bastards in Germany, and they were all killed in the ensuing firefight. In his place, I shall take over.\" This was believed by some, but challenger were already coming out of the woodworks. Ivan Romanovsky, a fellow general, declared that he had evidence that the \"anarchists\" were, in fact, agents of Drozdovsky, and that the people of Russia now needed to rally against him and his regime.\n\nThe military is split right down the middle on who to support. The navy had always been a pro-Kolchak stronghold, as he had been a naval officer and had invested heavily in upgrading the navy. The army, on the other hand, is strongly in favour of Drozdovsky, and many generals believe that sucking up to him will be better for getting spending in the long run. These divisions are going to be influencing our politics for years to come, it seems."
russia.4.a:0 "I thought the Japanese had it bad when it comes to sectarian military conflict!"
russia.5.t:0 "Kolchak Exposes Drozdovsky"
russia.5.desc:0 "“\"People of Russia, so fair and wise in your habits and traditions. Let me ask you; what is worse than a mere enemy?\" Kolchak asked over radio. He had miraculously survived an assassination attempt a day ago thanks to the sacrifice of the squad’s leading officer, who jumped in the way of the bullets to save him. \"What’s worse is a traitor! A backstabbing, snake in the grass, good for nothing traitor! And I know of one in our ranks; Mikhail Drozdovsky.\" He further alleged that Drozdovsky had disguised his men as anarchists in order to divert blame, and was attempting to make himself Supreme Leader of Russia.\n\nDrozdovsky has challenged these claims, and has further asserted that Kolchak had hired anarchist partisans in an attempt to eliminate him. In response to all of this, the military is split right down the middle on who to support. The navy had always been a pro-Kolchak stronghold, as he had been a naval officer and had invested heavily in upgrading the navy. The army, on the other hand, is strongly in favour of Drozdovsky, and many generals believe that sucking up to him will be better for getting spending in the long run. These divisions are going to be influencing our politics for years to come, it seems." 
russia.5.a:0 "Christ in heaven, can’t we just have a peaceful day for once?!"
russia.6.t:0 "하계 정변투쟁"
russia.6.desc:0 "The aftermath of the attack on Supreme Leader Kolchak has left the political climate unbelievably tense. Armed groups have formed, proclaiming their loyalty to either Kolchak or Drozdovsky, and they’ve already clashed before over whatever happens to get them upset. But today, its gone violent; a Kolchakist clique in Moscow has gotten into a firefight with a pro-Drozdovsky group, ending with the Drozdovskists storming government buildings and proclaiming the current government illegitimate. Mikhail has joined these men, proclaiming himself the leader of the new Russia and has organized the army in order to defend the new regime.\n\nKolchak and his supporters, on the other hand, has fled to Kazan, where they’ve established a new government in order to hold their ground and eventually take down the traitors. Now, the people must choose between the admiral and the general; the fate of Russia is in their hands."
russia.6.a:0 "Kolchak's Clique is the legitimate ruler! Mother Russia must survive!"
russia.6.b:0 "Down with Kolchak's Clique! Long live Drozdovsky!"
russia.7.t:0 "11월 파업의 유산"
russia.7.desc:0 "Since those disasterous strikes that were called by the Workers' Councils last November, there has been an uneasy tension between our legitimate government and the downtrodden workers. The strikes were of course broken by our brave police forces and many of the ringleaders arrested for illegal striking but the Supreme Leader has taken personal interest in this affair, delcaring that the schism between the government and workers must be mended, by any means necessary. Two proposals were put forward by Kolchak's council; one which suggested we complete the crackdowns we should have done in Novemeber with arresting more of the organising workers, while another suggests releasing the less volatile leaders and allowing the Workers' Councils to reform, albeit under State supervision."   
russia.7.a:0 "We'll not become another Germany, finish off the Workers' Councils"
russia.7.b:0 "A heavy-handed response will only aggrivate the situation, allow some Councils."
russia.8.t:0 "The Republican Investigation"
russia.8.desc:0 "Despite a thorough investigation by the experienced Secret Police, there was little of substance connecting the Republican elements of the various parties with the more Socialist strikers. The few connections were little more than individual Liberal politicians speaking out against police brutality or declaring that a dialogue must be opened with the strikers. While certainly treasonous and anti-Russian behavior, punishing them won't totally end the Republican movement in Russia."
russia.8.a:0 "\"Find\" some more evidence, then implicate the democratic parties."
russia.8.b:0 "We can't leave without something to show, lock up some Liberals."
russia.9.t:0 "The IXth Duma Elections"
russia.9.desc:0 "If you're seeing this, something's gone wrong."
russia.9.a:0 "I didn't cheat! I swear!"

The young guard that was the first step to the foundation of our party, will be the first step to the birth of the new Russians who will do away with materialism, internationalism and egalitarianism."

###Starting tree###
RUS_november_strike:0 "11월 파업의 여파"
RUS_november_strike_desc:0 "In November the Workers' Councils in many large cities coordinated to bring our modernization of industry to a halt. The Police responded too quickly, allowing many of the Strike orgainisers to flee and force a response from the Duma. While the Strikes have settled since then, they never truly ended as workers and police curse each other in the street. The Supreme Leader demands an answer to this tension."
RUS_dismiss_nechvolodov:0 "Dismiss Nechvolodov"
RUS_dismiss_nechvolodov_desc:0 "Whatever General Nechvolodov's credentials, his overt anti-semitism and collaboration with the more extreme factions of the Black Hundereds is unacceptable of a State army officer. Supreme Leader Kolchak has demanded his resignation, despite the protests from the Army who see Nechvolodov as one of their own."
RUS_subsidize_black_hundreds:0 "Subsidize Black Hundredist Parties"
RUS_subsidize_black_hundreds_desc:0 "While the Black Hundreds have some unsavory radical factions, they are at least nationalists through and through and the reality is that our government cannot stand alone in the face of rising Republican and Socialist popularity. By subsidising the campaigns of the Black Hundereds through fake organizations, we can improve their performance in the elections while keeping our own hands clean." 
RUS_osvag_campaign:0 "반사회주의 활동"
RUS_osvag_campaign_desc:0 "With OSVAG, the army's own Information Bureau of the Department of Propaganda, and by reaching some agreements with its often uncooperative Army directors we shall run an anti-Socialist campaign, glorifying Kolchak as a Defender of Russia in the face of the Red Menace."
RUS_investigate_strike:0 "Investigate Striker-Republican connections"
RUS_investigate_strike_desc:0 "The Republicans are opportunist snakes, this is certain, yet many whisper in Kolchak's ear that they are little more than Socialists with a lick of paint. Pragmatic as ever, the Supreme Leader has decided to launch an investigation into any connection between the Republican parties and the treacherous, Socialist strikers."
RUS_last_session_duma:0 "Last Session of the VIIIth State Duma"
RUS_last_session_duma_desc:0 "With the strike settled and the future election setup to continue the Supreme Leader's grand tutelage, there is little for the Duma to do save act as though they have any power and pass through the latest Naval Budget so that we may begin to project our power in the Mediterranean, as we should have decades ago."
RUS_prepare_fleet:0 "Naval Exercises in the Mediterranean"
RUS_prepare_fleet_desc:0 "With the new Naval Budget we can afford to test our ships in the warm waters of the Mediterranean, for no longer can the Brits or Turks block our mighty navy from sailing beyond the Straits. With this triumph for the Russian Navy and Nation, all can see that it is Supreme Leader Kolchak's tutelage which has lead Russia to the modern era, and it is with him that we shall ascend beyond a mere regional power."
RUS_admiral_vacation:0 "The Summer Vacation"
RUS_admiral_vacation_desc:0 "With the most pressing affairs settled, their is little for our hardworking Leader to do beyond wait for the fruits of his labour to grow. As such, it is only right that the Supreme Leader take a relaxing vacation to his favourite region of Yalta, along with a cadre of loyal bodyguards, of course."
RUS_like_a_dream:0 "Like a dream"
RUS_like_a_dream_desc:0 "With Kolchak relaxing in Yalta and the Navy reporting excellent maneuvers in the Mediterranean, it seems that the future of Russia is bright like never before. The Italians are in economic crisis, the French are frothing madmen and the British seems amicable. There will be little to stop our proud nation from asserting hegemony over the Balkans as we should have after the Great War."
RUS_ix_duma_election:0 "Elections to the IXth State Duma"
RUS_ix_duma_election_desc:0 "After a little break, it seems Kolchak is ready to return to business. Our previous efforts should make the Duma election a mere formality to secure a cooperative coalition of Black Hundereds and other noble nationalists within the Duma. Should anything unexpected occur, we have the Army and Navy to rely on, so a cursed revolution like that of 1922 can never occur again."

RUS_eternal_regent_desc:0 "Despite the whining and crying of the monarchists, we have no need for their petty kings. After all, as our Supreme Leader fought bravely for our nation, the impotent Romanovs fled in shame. We have no need for fools."
RUS_expand_okhrana:0 "오흐라나 확대"
RUS_expand_okhrana_desc:0 "As political poisons pump through the veins of our once-great nation, only the strongest purge can destroy this toxic treachery. While we may have disregarded the Tsar, his family’s method of eliminating opposition is certainly a fine prototype..."
RUS_expand_osvag:0 "OSVAG 확대"
RUS_expand_osvag_desc:0 "Unfortunately, disgusting traitors and foreign invaders have penetrated the depths of our people’s minds, and only the finest blade can excise this cultural cancer.

RUS_cult_kolchak:0 "최고지도자 숭배"

RUS_reorganize_council:0 "Council of the Supreme Ruler"
RUS_reorganize_council_desc:0 "In a land of great leaders and proud monarchs, a council of oligarchs is an antiquated obstacle to our leadership. As a gesture, we can keep the council, so long as it remains a mere “democratic” stamp-of-approval."
RUS_illusion_order:0 "Illusion of Legitimatcy"
RUS_illusion_order_desc:0 "Having restored a state by the will of the people, the oligarchs and traitors quake in their boots at the might of our nation. Before these naysayers can give delusions of “illegitimacy” to our vulnerable people, we must put down these lies by any means necessary."
