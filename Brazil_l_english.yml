BRA_morning_after_desc:0 "While our Pajama Revolution was not as bloody as the European revolutions, it is also incomplete. Reactionary oligarchs sit idle in their pseudo-feudal states and regional militias act as though the Federal Government was not overthrown mere months ago. Rather than allow the forces of counter-revolution to gather and strike, we will begin planning for the future and securing a stable foundation for our new revolutionary republic."
BRA_the_venue:0 "The Venue"
BRA_the_venue_desc:0 "Selecting a location for the first Council is important, it will allow us to determine the crowds' involvement, the ease of security and how easily we can bully delegates (should we so desire)."
BRA_the_delegates:0 "The Delegates"
BRA_the_delegates_desc:0 "Everyone who is anyone in Brazilian politics will want to be present, perhaps the oligarchs alone will be content to sit in their mansions while the Council is ongoing. While we wish to be democratic and representative of the Brazilian people, we must address whether we will allow reactionaries and capitalists to sit in on our Council."
BRA_the_security:0 "The Security"
BRA_the_security_desc:0 "The revolutionary militias were truly the instigators and propagators of the revolution, yet they are worryingly unreliable. Müller alone seems to have organised a disciplined Red Guard, with the rest of the militias associating themselves with their local Trade Union or political representative. To ensure the Reactionaries do not take advantage of the gathering of the nations' greatest revolutionaries, we must ensure security."

BRA_down_witchcraft_desc:0 "A worrying number of Brazilian citizens still practice pagan and heretical beliefs. While the native folk in their distant villages are of little concern to us - beyond our task of saving their eternal soul - we can use acqusations of witchcraft against our political opponents and leverage popular opinion against them. After all, how could a frothing futurist or a ruthless dictator every be a true Christian."

BRA_catholic_schools_desc:0 "In the Old World, Christianity created a group of learned men in the bishops and priests, at a time when even nobles did not read or write.

brazil.1.title:0 "The Pajama Revolution"
brazil.1.desc:0 "When a clique of pro slavery military officers launched a coup against the Brazilian Emperor Pedro II in 1889, none of them could have expected what was to come in the following decades. Since 1889 Brazil had been an oligarchic republic ruled from the states o Minas Geraes and São Paulo, known as the coffee and milk Republic, marked by instability, short lived dictatorships (Deodoro, Floriano and Arthur Bernardes), civil strife, racism and a overall nonexistence of central government. Authority was applied by the local oligarchs and landowners with their own militias and interests in mind, creating a pressure that moved ever closer to exploding into full-scale civil war.\n\nIn 1930 the acting oligarch, Washington Luís, contemplated the possibility of creating a national unity government to revitalize the decaying system, but instead decided to continue the old coffee and milk policy by appointing Antonio Carlos de Andrada, a politician from Minas Geraes as the next country president. The Andrada government was plagued by the same civil strife of the 1910s and 1920s with aggravation coming from the rising left wing tenentistas of the army, a threat dismissed by the ruling oligarchy who appointed his last president in 1934, Armando Salles de Oliveira, who would rule for one year alone.\n\nOn November 23 of 1935 the Pajama Revolution began in Rio de Janeiro. An event planned months prior began with soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Regiment cutting the throats of their still sleeping roommates before seizing of the capital, under the command of the controversial - and also brutal - Filinto Muller, the mind behind the revolution. Similar uprisings happened in Natal and Recife in the north, while Luís Carlos Prestes led his own armed revolution in Rio Grande do Sul. By the end of December Armando Salles and other figures of the government embarked on the dreadnought Minas Geraes and fled to the USA, where a powerless government in exile was set up.\n\nBrazil in January 1936 is a new socialist republic, though what the future holds is unknown. As the remnants of the old order plan their own conspiracies, it is up to the new government to unite under a new faction and guide the prosperous, progressive Republic to the future."
brazil.1.a:0 "Poder Popular."
brazil.2.t:0 "The Wake of the Revolution"
brazil.2.desc:0 "It has been a short few months since the Pajama Revolution and the Communist coup d'etat of the Federal government. There has been no major outburst of conflict, owing largely to the extremely decentralised nature of the Brazilian administration. The Communists of varying breeds ousted rivals in their own regions, while the oligarchs in the south and northeast were left relatively untouched. Even Filinto Müller, the German-trained mastermind of the Revolution, is not monolithic amongst the communists as his relationship with the Germans worries many moderates.\n\nAll the leaders of the various left-wing militias at least agree that a congress is necessary to ensure the survival and stability of the new revolutionary republic."
brazil.2.a:0 "Let's get to work then."
brazil.3.t:0 "Selecting the Venue"
brazil.3.desc:0 "The location of the first Council has been the subject of debate these past few weeks. Prestes' Orthodox Marxists believe that we should hold the discussion within a large football stadium, allowing masses of workers to sit in and view their future representatives at work. Müller suggests using a former Government building (one of the few not severly damaged by the revolution at least) which will certainly give a sense of normalcy and allow Müller's forces to secure the premises easier. Strangely, a group of Priests and religious leaders who spoke in favour of the revolution, lead largely by Francisco de Aquino Correia, have suggested using a local Cathedral to host the Council, believing no good Brazilian would dare attack holy ground."
brazil.3.a:0 "The Stadium, let the workers be heard."
brazil.3.b:0 "The Government building, legitimacy is important."
brazil.3.c:0 "The Cathedral, on God's grounds."
brazil.4.t:0 "Checking the Delegates"
brazil.4.desc:0 "To be a truly revolutionary republic we must first expunge the reactionary essense from our nation, a task made difficult if we allow the mislead proletariat to support them at the Council. The question has thus become to what degree do we restrict outsider delegates from standing at the Council. Prestes has suggested allowing non-communist Trade Union and Worker Council leaders to be present, believeing that they can be turned to our cause. Müller takes a hardline stance and believes that no non-Communists beyond the most influential regional leaders should be present. Once again, Correia's clique of Priests petitions to be given permission to give speeches at the Council, and perhaps stand as delegates for their parishes. The foolish notion of allowing anyone to appear at the Council was raised, but quickly rejected by Müller and Prestes' groups."
brazil.4.a:0 "Let the Worker Council representatives be present."
brazil.4.b:0 "The Communists must dominate the talks."
brazil.4.c:0 "What harm can some Priests do?"
brazil.4.d:0 "We must be a free, open democracy if we seek change."
brazil.5.t:0 "Securing the Council"
brazil.5.desc:0 "Perhaps the most important affair is ensuring that counter-revolutionary forces cannot attack the gathered leaders of the revolution during the Council. There is still a general air of tension in the capital and even socialist-aligned militias are mistrusting of other militias, unsure whether one will attempt to cut their throats as in the initiation of the revolution. Prestes believes that a show of unity by employing various Workers' and Soldiers' Militias to guard the Council will be beneficial. Müller suggested of course that his elite Red Guard should be the sole guardians of the Council, which was fervently argued over by the other leaders. Müller suggested a compromise, utilising the former state police, a neutral entity, to guard nearby points of interest while loyal cardes of guards are allowed for each delegate."
brazil.5.a:0 "The Worker and Soldier Militias are the face of our revolution, lets us them."
brazil.5.b:0 "Whatever the others' protests, the Red Guard are unwavering."
brazil.5.c:0 "Let's put the police to use, our loyal militias are close enough should they try anything."
brazil.6.t:0 "The outcome of the First Council"
brazil.6.desc:0 "Today, the various delegates of the revolutionary groups met in the chosen venue and spoke for hours about the future structure of the revolutionary republic, the role of the President, the division of powers and of course, the spread of the revolution. Despite a great plurality of representatives, the atmosphere of the Council seemed to lead to one conclusion and by the end of the day..."
brazil.6.a:0 "Prestes' Orthodox faction was dominant."
brazil.6.b:0 "Müller retained the Vanguard."
brazil.6.c:0 "Francisco de Aquino Correia surprised all with his victory."
brazil.6.d:0 "firefights between the police and revolutionary militias interrupted the discussions!"
brazil.7.t:0 "The Oligarchic Counter-Revolution"
brazil.7.desc:0 ""
brazil.7.a:0 "Let's finish off these reactionaries!"
brazil.7.b:0 "These Red murders must be destroyed! (Play as the Republic of Brazil)"
brazil.8.t:0 "The Counter-Revolution Succeeds"
brazil.8.desc:0 ""
brazil.8.a:0 "Central Authority is necessary for the prosperity of Brazil."
brazil.8.b:0 "Let the Oligarchs manage their own states."
brazil.9.t:0 "Colapso Geral de Autoridade"
brazil.9.desc:0 "\"Brazil was never meant to be a country and neither have a central government. For ages we oligarchs have been restrained from taking direct control of our matters by the damned political parties with their fancy european ideals of \"democracy\" or \"order\" and \"progress\". No more. We shall take direct control and the population must learn once for all their place.\"\n\nAs the counter-revolution ended, the Brazilian Right failed to fully estabilish control over the country and reform the government. In the whole country regional oligarchs lynch people in the streets and use their own militias to control areas that quickly devolves into feudalism. State governors are no more, the president is purely cerimonial and even the states armies are now crushed by a series of regional militias, known as \"jagunços\" who patrols the main cities in search for dissent. Worker's laws are revoked, the supreme court is no more, the constitution is not valid, the only order that Brazil shall have is the one imposed by the true rulers of the country since it's independence: the regional oligarchies."
brazil.9.a:0 "Espera, n-"
brazil.9.b:0 "Podemos con-"
brazil.9.c:0 "Whatever, I never really liked this country."
