germany.3.desc:0 "Today, comrades from all over Germany have gathered in the prussian House of representatives in Berlin. Many important matters of economy, politics and military were discussed, but on the fifth and last day of the Congress, the most important decisions of all was made- who would lead Germany into the future. All parties had good speakers. The KPD spoke of Revolution and Progress, the USPD of Peace and Freedom and the NMAPD of Unity and Strength. But after everything they decided to choose..."

germany.4.desc:0 "In an ever grandiose and theatrical speech to the German masses, Joseph Goebbels took to the stage in his unique fashion and spoke of his new vision for Germany...\n\n\"Comrades….how long has it been since we first broke off the chains of capitalist oppression? It has been decades has it not? And yet what has occured since, despite our miraculous revolution? What has occured has been a travesty comrades. The job was left half finished! Across the continent, our comrades were butchered by depraved acts of White Terror. The degenerate French ran our good comrades out of the nation and now they sit eagerly on our borders looking to impose their proto-reactionary agenda on us. The British impose the same dictatorial bourgeois hegemony as they always have, keeping down the flames of proletariat revolution. All of this has occurred to the detriment of the great German nation and its socialist people. No more will this travesty be allowed to occur.\"\n\n\"The revisionism has come to an end. In its place, arises the true vanguard of the German workers. The National Majority Workers Party of Germany is here and it will stay here. As the protectorate of the workers and as a protectorate of Germany against the anti-Red reptiles that plague the Earth. The age of half measured socialism is over. In its place, a new socialism takes root. One that will go all the way to free every man woman and child from the yoke of bourgeois hegemony. The plundering of our people is at an end. Now is the time for our Red retribution. And we will make no apologies for our rightful revenge.\""
germany.4.a:0 "A new dawn of socialism has begun dear comrades."
germany.5.t:0 "A speech by Comrade Frahm"
germany.5.desc:0 "After his rise to power, Comrade Frahm has addressed the public:\n\n\"I can still hear the screams from the trenches. They call out for mercy and for peace. They do not desire war anymore; they want to come home. While my opponents have insisted that the only way we shall survive is to fight, I think differently. There is a path to peace for Germany; through diplomacy and alliances, we can survive and come out stronger for it.\"\n\n\"Futurists, capitalists and reactionaries all think that the only way to solve an issue is violence. Even some socialists think this way. I do not; I have seen what war does to a nation, and it is not pretty. The soldiers agree with me on this, and you do as well; you want peace. So let us have it, at long last!\""
germany.5.a:0 "Long live Chairman Frahm!"
germany.6.t:0 "The Notice"
germany.6.desc:0 "Despite the prestigious honor that comes from winning in an election, the KPD has not scheduled a speech for its candidate.

The public is pretty upset despite their attempts to calm everything down."
germany.6.a:0 "Business as usual I suppose..."
germany.7.t:0 "Comrade Sedov's Address"
germany.7.desc:0 "Today, Comrade Sedov has addressed the Public:\n\n\"It has been more than 16 years now since I have been chased from Russia. I have seen the White Terror of Koltchak and his goons as they ripped and tore through that beautiful country. And all for the establishment of a personal dictatorship led by a foolish, stupid man. In a lot of ways, your position is much the same; Austria and Prussia look to carve up our nation into two pieces, and those lunatics in France won’t be content until we are wiped from the map! I will not let this happen, comrades!\"\n\n\"Germany has principles; good principles, of democracy and freedom. That must continue to exist, but it will not exist if we allow ourselves to be conquered. Instead of pacifism or anarchism, I offer a more responsible government, and a renewed armaments program, to ensure that our armies can repel the reactionaries and Futurists which assault us. The party shall not merely be another political organization; it shall be the harbinger of socialism to all of Europe. We shall all be free of tyranny; the Internationale shall unite the human race!\""
germany.7.a:0 "A beautiful speech."
germany.8.t:0 "Comrade Meyer's Speech"
germany.8.desc:0 "Today, Comrade Meyer addressed the Public:\n\n\"Comrade Luxemburg once said that Germany had two options coming out of the war: socialism or barbarism. We could either continue to let things get worse, and be either stuck with a capitalist state or a Futurist dictatorship, or we could pick something different. Something far more humane and democratic than any current system. Today, I stand before you all as that alternative!\"\n\n\"This nation shall never again be subject to the terrors and tyranny of other nations and their decrepit systems of government and economics. We shall shine bright as a model to all the world, and prove that socialism is the future! Barbarism shall never reach our lands, as long as we stand firm and resilient!\""

germany.bavaria.desc:0 "After we now know about the ideas to turn Bavaria against us, we cannot ignore it much longer. We have to act fast, before Bavaria destabilises even further! However, there are two ideas brought forth in the Reichsrätekongress: Comrade Georg Engl wants to appease the Bavarians by giving more power to the Peasant’s Councils and highering the standard of living in the Countryside. Comrade Hermann Gartmann, on the other hand, thinks that we should collectivise the Land and use our VkRSS to solve the situation."
germany.bavaria.a:0 "Engl is right, violence brings us nowhere."
germany.bavaria.b:0 "Gartmann is right, we need to show strength."

germany.9.t:0 "VIII. Weltkongress der Internationale"
germany.9.desc:0 "The goal of this meeting of the Internationale is arguably the most important since its founding. While previous ones discuss domestic policy and the road to power, this one will be mainly focused on Germany’s foreign policy and the way we interact with the world in the years to come. Questions like national self-determination, anti-colonialism, economic relations and even the forming of governments-in-exile will all be put to vote by the congress.\n\nClass warfare cannot merely be a struggle of party against the national bourgeoisie. This next war will be the struggle of a proletarian nation against the international capitalist class and all the influence they have upon the world. In order to break it, every tool in our arsenal must be used, because the capitalists will use every tool in their arsenal as well. Our conflict is just; as Trotsky says, \"A slave-owner who through cunning and violence shackles a slave in chains, and a slave who through cunning or violence breaks the chains – let not the contemptible eunuchs tell us that they are equals before a court of morality!\""
germany.9.a:0 "Let the congress begin!"

germany.10.t:0 "Germany approaches us"
germany.10.desc:0 "Today, the German Ambassador in Bergen has approached our Government and has proposed a united Arctic Naval Expedition, to find new Passages and strengthen the Bond between our Nations. Our Naval Commanders agree that an Expedition would be beneficial for our overall Navy experience and mapping of the north pole is a project worthy of committing too. Some fear, however, that Germanie advances are to draw us into the third International. And then there are some who also think that Germany wants to do that, but think that would be a good thing. What should we do?"
germany.10.a:0 "Yes, expeditions to the North pole would be good, but we don’t need the Germans."
germany.10.b:0 "A great idea! We will sail with our German Comrades!"
